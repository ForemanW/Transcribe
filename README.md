# Transcribe
To use: clone this repo, run transcribe.py, and input the path to your desired input.fasta and output.fasta files when prompted. 

A fun side-project I created, inspired by a problem prompt at rosalind.info. This script reads in a fasta file of DNA sequences, transcribes each element to its corresponding RNA sequence, and outputs the RNA sequences in a new output fasta file.
